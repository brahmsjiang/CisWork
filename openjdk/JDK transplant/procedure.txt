1. docker file modify
vim dockerfile


2. toolchain, extrafile necessary:
https://cisco-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/chcole2/En6RCOvA8qlJvX-K4kq08GkB-8nGVIDSKw9-mFpNy5dPIw
openjdk-extra-depend folder

we need to figure out merge it into current toolchain used. e.x, download it from URL.
Curently, use wget to download them to .cache/cisco/toolchain


3. compare openjdk's build.sh with os/linux/xx/build.py, try to invoke os build openjdk automatically.
os would compare a ver of post merge, sl-main uses this ver(commit-id) to download corresponding rootfs tar to .cache/cisco/bbb/xxxxx
and unzip it to _build/bbb/rootfs, finally pake them into a load pageage.
These mentioned should be accomplished by genmake.
